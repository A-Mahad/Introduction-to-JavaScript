// Rock, Paper, Scissors - Let's play against the computer!
/*
Create a global variable that randomly generates the computer's choice
Use Math.random to determine the computers choice (Math.random gives a random number between 0 and 1)

HINT: While you can complete this with only conditionals based on strings, it may help to equate choice to a number when using Math.random()

Use the game function below to do the following:
  1. Receive 2 parameters the user's choice and the computer's choice
  2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below - the strings returned need to match the strings below exactly.
   - win should return "you win!"
   - lose should return "you lose!"
   - tie should return "it's a tie"
  
  RULES OF THE GAME: Scissors beats Paper | Paper beats Rock | Rock beats Scissors | Or there's a tie
  
  HINT: Remember that the order in which we pass in our arguments matters when it comes to parameters
